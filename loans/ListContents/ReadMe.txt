ListContents by Jordan McCrindle
--------------------------------

The ListContents.exe writes the contents of a specified directory to a text file 'Contents', stored in that directory. To scan a whole
drive just specify the drive as a directory (i.e. 'c:\'). Folders are listed in order of size (in bytes), with their files inside.

The ListContents.exe should be run as an administrator so as to have permission to create the 'Contents' text file in whichever directory
 is to be listed.
